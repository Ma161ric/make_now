# Competitive Analysis: DayFlow vs Motion vs Trevor.ai

## Market Positioning

DayFlow is a **guided daily planning tool** - sits between Motion (auto-scheduler) and Trevor.ai (time tracker).

### The Three Approaches

| Approach | App | Model | Strength | Weakness |
|----------|-----|-------|----------|----------|
| **Automated Scheduling** | Motion | AI decides when you work (auto-blocks calendar) | Passive, effortless | No user control, feels rigid |
| **Passive Time Tracking** | Trevor.ai | Tracks what you did (measures time) | Privacy-focused, learns patterns | No planning, reactive only |
| **Guided Planning** | DayFlow | AI proposes, you confirm (human + AI) | Intentional, learned, reflective | More user input required |
